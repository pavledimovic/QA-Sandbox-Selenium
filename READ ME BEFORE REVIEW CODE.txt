QA-Sandbox test

There are 2 repositories in Git 

1. QA-Sandbox-Selenium        "https://github.com/pavledimovic/QA-Sandbox-Selenium.git"

2. QA-Sandbox-Gemini-Hermione "https://github.com/pavledimovic/QA-Sandbox-Gemini-Hermione.git"

QA-Sandbox-Selenium is standard Selenium test written in Java, using TestNG framework and Maven build tool in order that tests can easily be runned by Jenkins CI, I can use Gherkin BDD syntax if needed as well. I wrote few additional test and added in suite so you can have better perspective of principles that I am using.

QA-Sandbox-Gemini-Hermione is CSS pixel comparason tool and I wrote some tests for Login page using Java Script language, in order to to start these tests you need to install Gemini by running few commands in comand line:
- npm install -g gemini
- npm install gemini
- npm install -g selenium-standalone
- selenium-standalone install
- selenium standalone-start &

For running tests we have 2 basic commands
- gemini update (to capture referent screenshots)
- gemini test (to compareref and actual screenshots)
HTML report will be generated and can be viewed in browser

I Am using Postman tool for API testing , Android Espresso for Android testing and Appium for IOS testing.
I Have Jenkins CI skills for web and mobile testing.
